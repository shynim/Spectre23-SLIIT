## Expected Robot Design

The maze-solving robot is designed to autonomously navigate through complex mazes efficiently. It incorporates several key components to achieve its objective, providing a reliable and efficient solution for maze challenges. The central control unit of the robot is an Arduino microcontroller, responsible for controlling its movements and decision-making processes throughout the maze-solving journey.

To detect the walls within the maze, the robot is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors. Two of these sensors are positioned on the sides, offering a wide range of perception, while the third sensor is located at the front, enabling the robot to sense walls directly ahead. These sensors allow the robot to effectively navigate through narrow passages and avoid collisions with maze

walls, ensuring smooth progress throughout the maze. For precise and controlled movement within the maze, the robot utilizes N20-type gear motors with encoders. These motors provide accurate feedback on the robot's position, allowing it to move with precision and make necessary adjustments for efficient maze traversal. With this

capability, the robot can maintain a steady course, smoothly maneuvering through the maze's

configurations of walls.

The robot is also equipped with a Pololu QTR-8RC sensor array to detect colors within its path. This functionality can be used to identify specific color markers within the maze. For example, it could be used to detect a red square at the end of the maze, indicating the robot's successful completion of the maze-solving task.

To power its operations, the robot relies on a 3-cell LiPo battery, providing sufficient energy for prolonged maze exploration. Despite its compact size of 14.5x11.5x10.5, the robot is designed to navigate through narrow passageways and maneuver effectively in confined spaces.

In summary, the maze-solving robot utilizes ultrasonic sensors, encoders, color sensors, and an Arduino microcontroller to autonomously navigate mazes. It can effectively detect walls, make precise movements, and optionally detect color markers such as the red square at the end of the maze. With its reliable navigation and compact design, the robot offers an efficient solution for successfully solving complex maze challenges.
